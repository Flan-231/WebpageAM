    <h2> Get to know me :) ^~^</h2> 
    
    <p> Hello, this is a webpage to get to know me, <br> 
      it's mainly going to be about dancing but also <br> 
      other things that I like/ intereted in. I like <br> 
      to dance because of it's versatility and how <br> 
      each dance can be uniquely yours. Then music <br>
      already I love so much, so with dancing I could <br>
      bring a song to life through movement in any way <br> 
      that I would like. </p>
  
    <h2> Types of dances that I know </h2> 
    
   <ul>
  <li>Hip hop  </li>
  <li> cumbias </li>
  <li>Salsa </li>
  <li> Merengue </li>
</ul>  

 <h2> Types of dances that I want to learn; &#128512;&#128511; </h2>  

<ul>
  <li> Ballet folkorico </li>
  <li> Jazz </li>
  <li> Contemporary </li>

</ul>  
    
    <h2> The Jabbawockeez </h2>  
  <p> I was introduced to the Jabbawockeez becasue of my sister, <br> she was obsessed with them so a long time, now not so much <br> but now im getting more into them. I really enjoy their style of dance <br> and the fact that you cann't see any of their faces adds a bit of mystery. </p>
